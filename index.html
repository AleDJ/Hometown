                    <h4>More cows than people</h4>
                    <p>There are over 700,000 cows in Switzerland. With a population of 8.57 million inhabitants,
                        this means that one in twelve has a cow. Of course, the cows mostly live in herds on farms,
                        so it is rumored that in some villages in Switzerland there are more cows than people.</p>

                    <h4>Highest peaks in Europe</h4>
                    <p>Switzerland is home to numerous mountains which are over 3,000 meters high.
                        A beautiful experience for hikers is the Chamonix-Zermatt Haute Route, a 12-day classic
                        Alpine trek that will bring you straight to the well-recognized Matterhorn.
                        With 48 mountain peaks that are above 4000 meters, Switzerland has more high peaks than
                        any other country in Europe.</p>

                    <h4>Switzerland Has 7000 Lakes</h4>
                    <p>Switzerland's lakes are the best ones to swim in and you have plenty to choose from.
                        With an area of 580.03 km2, Lake Geneva is the largest lake in Switzerland.
                        For the most part, the freshwater is so clear that you can drink out of rivers and lakes.
                        Only if you cannot see the bottom of a lake is it considered dirty.</p>
